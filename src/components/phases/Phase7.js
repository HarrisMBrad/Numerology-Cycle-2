      <p>And it's <code style={styles.code}>/onStart</code> perfect.</p>
      <p>Seriously, what the <code style={styles.code}>/onUpdate</code> else do you want?</p>
      <p>
        You probably build websites and think your shit is special. You think your
        13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some [] Award banner
        you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery
        file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a boner because it finally has a box-shadow.
        Wrong, [].
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.heading}>The Perfect Website:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It's lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your [/] screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all your [/] browsers</li>
        <li>The [/] is accessible to every pathway that visits your site</li>
        <li>[/] is legible and gets your [/] point across</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Well guess what, []:</p>
      <p><strong>You. Are. Over-designing.</strong></p>
      <p>
        Look at this shit. It's a [/] website. Why the [] do you need to animate a []
        trendy-[] banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of []?
      </p>
      <p>
        You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your [] site, and some []
        jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that [].
        Not to mention blind people will never see that [], but they don't see any
        of your [] typescript [].
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.heading}>This is your perfect website. Here’s why:</h2>

      <h3>It’s [] lightweight</h3>
      <p>
        This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed Facebook logo on your
        [] [] site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate
        the [] background color of a div?
      </p>

      <h3>It’s responsive</h3>
      <p>
        You []. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive
        means that it responds to whatever [] screen size it's viewed on. This site
        doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a [] [].
      </p>

      <h3>It [] works</h3>
      <p>
        Look at this []. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, []. It makes
        sense. It has [] hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your bitch-ass
        browser know what the []'s in this [] site. That’s semantics, [].
      </p>

      <p>
        It has content on the [] screen. Your site has three bylines and links to your
        Dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some
        bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Cross-browser compatibility?</strong> Load this [] in IE6. I [] dare you.</p>

      <h2 style={styles.heading}>This is a website.</h2>
      <p>
        Look at it. You've never seen one before. Like the man who's never grown out his
        beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no [] idea what a website is.
      </p>

      <p>
        All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic covert/bastardizations of what should be
        text communicating a [] message. This is a brforeal, naked website.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.heading}>It’s [] beautiful.</h2>

      <p>Yes, this is [] satire, you [].</p>

      <p>
        I'm not actually saying your [] site should look like this. What I'm saying is that
        all the problems we have with websites are ones we create ourselves. Websites
        aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible.
        You break them. You son-of-ai-[].
