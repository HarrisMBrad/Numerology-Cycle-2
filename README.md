# TITAN TALK Integration Project | Cycle-2: Partnership & Balance

## üîç Overview

This repository evolves the TITAN / Voro8 system into **Cycle-2**, reflecting the theme of **Partnership & Balance**. Driven by **daily numerology**, the system fuses decision logic, symbolic programming, and structured journaling into a human‚ÄìAI collaboration model.

This branch is a living artifact for tracking **co-processing** efforts between the Developer (Brad) and AI Agent (Voro8), guided by ritualized daily cycles and phase-based KPIs.

---

## üåê Purpose

To synchronize real-world development efforts with numerology-based cycles and symbolic decision frameworks, specifically:

- Enhancing robot-assisted planning (Market Analyzer, Knossos Navigator)
- Using ‚Äúcamoflause logic‚Äù to pattern strategy per weekday
- Advancing toward creative expression in Cycle-3 (next)

## üéôÔ∏è What is TITAN TALK?

**TITAN TALK** is a cognitive alignment protocol‚Äîused to encode prompts, decisions, and development loops. It is both:

- a narrative operating system  
- and a co-processing timeline between human + machine.
