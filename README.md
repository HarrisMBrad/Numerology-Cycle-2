# TITAN TALK Integration Project | Cycle-3: Creative Expansion

## üöÄ Status Update: Cycle-2 Closure

The **Cycle-2: Partnership & Balance** phase is complete and locked in. All validation steps, including the running of the full test suite, are finalized, officially concluding this milestone.

| Status Check | Detail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SCRUM-8** | ‚úÖ **Done** | The task "Run the full test suite (`npm test`/`pytest`)" is complete. Test runners are configured and successfully found and executed initial placeholder tests. This task is being moved to the **Jira Done Column**. |
| **Cycle-2 Logic** | ‚úÖ **Validated** | The lock-in date **06/23/2025** was validated to correctly reduce to the cycle number **2** ($6+5+9 = 20 \rightarrow 2$), confirming the **Partnership & Balance** theme. |
| **Branch State** | **Ready for Merge** | This branch is now the canonical record for Cycle-2 completion. |

## üîç Current Cycle Context: `Cycle-3 ‚Äì Creative Expansion`

We are now actively developing under the theme of **Creative Expansion**. This phase emphasizes **expression, synthesis, and the generation of new symbolic constructs**.

| Parameter | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Numerology Theme** | **3** | Represents Creativity, Communication, and Synthesis. |
| **Goal** | Generative Development | Focus on building modules that express or visualize core data. |
| **Immediate Focus** | New UI/Visualization Hooks | Setting up the React components and logic for the ASCII visualization and Journaling modules. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Stack & Setup

The project now utilizes a dual-stack approach, with all development dependencies confirmed operational.

| Component | Status | Setup Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **React Frontend** | ‚úÖ Operational | Development server run by `npm start` (which executes `webpack serve`). Tested via **Jest**. |
| **Core Utilities** | ‚úÖ Operational | Python utilities tested via **pytest** (ready for the main numerology logic). |
| **Test Command** | `npm test` | Runs **Jest** for JavaScript/React unit tests. |

## ü§ñ Active Robot Collaborators

All **Cycle-2** robots have completed their mandate. Their directives are now being updated to support the new generative and narrative development modes of Cycle-3.

| Robot Name | New Role Directive (Cycle-3) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Code Sentinel`** | Focusing on modularity and component structuring for visualization. |
| **`Market Analyzer`** | Generating new symbolic data patterns for synthetic trend simulation. |
| **`Knossos Navigator`** | Designing new integration pathways for **ASCII visualization** and journal entry tagging. |

## üìà Next Steps (Cycle-3 Development Plan)

1.  **FEAT:** Implement the core **Life Path** and **Personal Year** calculation logic in `numerologyUtils.js` (using Test-Driven Development).
2.  **FEAT:** Create the initial **`BirthDateForm`** React component to capture user input.
3.  **CHORE:** Set up initial **journaling data structure** for storage integration.
