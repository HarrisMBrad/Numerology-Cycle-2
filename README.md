# 📘 numerology-Cycle2.js

## 🔍 Overview

This file encodes a symbolic temporal map driven by **daily numerology**, mapped to real-world identity cycles and narrative progression. It’s part of a broader **Builder's Codex** initiative that fuses storyline, operational rhythm, and decision-making frameworks (like TITAN and MAL).

## 🌐 Purpose

To synchronize daily operations, coding sessions, and team awareness with numerology-based reflections. Each day includes:

- A **Numerology identity** (1 = Initiation, 2 = Alignment, 3 = Momentum...)
- A **system log trigger** (onStart/onUpdate/onStop)
- Symbolic and functional context
- Narrative alignment to chapters in the Builder’s Codex

## 🔁 Structure Breakdown

### 🕐 YESTERDAY – INITIATION (1)

```js
yesterday: {
  numerology: 1,
  event: "onStart",
  date: "04/06/2025",
  context: "Chapter 11 Complete",
  description: "The spark of intention. The system boot."
}
```

### 📍 TODAY – ALIGNMENT (2)

```js
today: {
  numerology: 2,
  event: "onUpdate",
  date: "04/07/2025",
  context: {
    chapter: 12,
    title: "Symmetry in the Second Stream",
    question: "How do we sustain alignment without sacrificing individuality?",
    answer: "Through collaborative code and story patterns, balance is not a compromise—it’s a structure."
  },
  theme: ["Cooperation", "Diplomacy", "Balance", "Partnership", "Sensitivity"]
}
```

### 🚀 TOMORROW – MOMENTUM (3)

```js
tomorrow: {
  numerology: 3,
  event: "onStop",
  date: "04/08/2025",
  preview: ["Momentum Shift", "Pattern Lock", "Builder’s Momentum (3)"]
}
```

## 📈 EOD Summary

```js
endOfDay: {
  numerologyWindow: [2, 3, 4],
  insight: "Today’s numerology (2) stabilizes the bridge between self and system...",
  logSummary: () => [
    "✅ Alignment Phase Active (2)",
    "🚧 Creative Tension Incoming (3)",
    "🚀 Execution Vector Locking (4)"
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Runtime Trigger

To verify the current phase:

```js
numerologyCycle.today.log();
console.table(numerologyCycle.endOfDay.logSummary());
```

## 🧭 Future Extension

This cycle system will grow to track 1–9 numerological days across:

- Coding behavior
- Builder’s Codex chapters
- Team identity sync
- Context triggers from the TITAN Deciders framework

Stay in sync. Build from intent.

> Numerology isn't superstition here—it's structure.
